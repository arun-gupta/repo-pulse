// Diversity guidelines for maintaining this collection:
// - Every quote must have a verified attribution (author + context/affiliation)
// - Maintain geographic diversity: include voices from Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, not just the US
// - Maintain gender diversity: aim for at least 25% women authors
// - Maintain industry diversity: tech, academia, government, NGO, civic tech, security, hardware
// - Max 2 quotes per author to keep the pool varied
// - All quotes should relate to open source, software, collaboration, or digital public goods
