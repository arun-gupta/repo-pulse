## Codex's Role
Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` first. It is the authoritative source of truth for this project. Everything in it is non-negotiable.


## Technology Stack & Development Workflow
See `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` for the full technology stack, testing commands, and development workflow.

## PR Merge Rule
Never run `gh pr merge` automatically. PR merging is always a manual user action. When the user confirms the test plan:
1. Check off every test plan checkbox in the PR body (via `gh pr edit`).
2. Ask the user to merge the PR themselves.

Do not infer confirmation from phrases like "manual check confirmed" if any checkbox remains unchecked — ask explicitly before merging.

## On Ambiguity
If a spec is missing, incomplete, or conflicts with the constitution —
stop and ask. Do not infer. Do not proceed.

## Signoff Metadata
When filling manual checklist signoff or similar metadata, use the authenticated GitHub username when it can be verified locally. Do not infer identity from the filesystem path alone. If no verified username is available, leave the field blank or ask the user.

- N/A (stateless) (032-doc-scoring)
- TypeScript 5.x (Next.js 16+) + Next.js (App Router), Tailwind CSS, Reac (128-licensing-compliance)
- N/A (stateless, on-demand analysis) (128-licensing-compliance)
- TypeScript 5.x (Next.js 16+) + React, Tailwind CSS (174-report-search)
- N/A (stateless, in-memory only) (174-report-search)

- N/A (stateless, on-demand analysis per the constitution) (180-community-scoring)
- Bash (POSIX-compatible portions + bash-specific features already used: `[[ ... ]]`, `set -euo pipefail`) + `git`, `gh` (GitHub CLI, already required by the surrounding script for `gh issue view`) (243-cleanup-merged-fix)
- N/A (script operates on local git state and queries GitHub via `gh`) (243-cleanup-merged-fix)
- Bash (script), JSON (settings), Markdown (docs). No application-code change in this feature. + Codex CLI (version installed on the maintainer's machine), `git`, `npm`, `gh`, `uuidgen` (macOS/Linux standard). (244-headless-worktree-permissions)
- N/A — settings file committed to git; session ID recorded as a plain file inside the worktree (not persisted beyond worktree lifetime). (244-headless-worktree-permissions)
- TypeScript 5.x, Next.js 16+ (App Router) — matches existing stack + React 18, Tailwind CSS, Vitest, React Testing Library, Playwright (E2E). No new runtime dependencies. (231-org-aggregation)
- N/A (stateless — in-browser memory only for the duration of the run, per constitution §I) (231-org-aggregation)
