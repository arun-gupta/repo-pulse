## Claude's Role
Read `.specify/memory/constitution.md` first. It is the authoritative source of truth for this project. Everything in it is non-negotiable.

## Feature Selection Order
When starting new feature work, follow this order exactly:

1. Read `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` first to identify the next feature to implement from the current implementation order.
2. Read `docs/PRODUCT.md` next to find the canonical product definition, acceptance criteria, and out-of-scope boundaries for that feature.
3. Then run the SpecKit lifecycle in order:
   - `/speckit.specify`
   - `/speckit.plan`
   - `/speckit.tasks`
   - `/speckit.implement`

## SpecKit Commands
Command definitions are available in `.claude/commands/`.

- `/speckit.specify` — generate spec
- `/speckit.plan` — generate plan
- `/speckit.tasks` — generate task list
- `/speckit.implement` — execute plan

These command definitions live in `.claude/commands/`.

## On Ambiguity
If a spec is missing, incomplete, or conflicts with the constitution — 
stop and ask. Do not infer. Do not proceed.
