# Implementation Plan: Org-Level Repo Inventory

**Branch**: `016-org-inventory` | **Date**: 2026-04-03 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)  
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/016-org-inventory/spec.md`

## Summary

Implement `P1-F16 Org-Level Repo Inventory` as a lightweight organization workspace that accepts a GitHub org slug or URL, fetches verified public repository metadata, and renders a sortable/filterable inventory table plus org-level rollups. This slice also adds configurable visible columns, row-level and bulk drill-in to the existing repo-analysis flow, and a slider-controlled bulk-selection limit that is capped by shared config and defaults to `5`.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5, React 19, Next.js 16.2 (App Router)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 16.2, Tailwind CSS 4, Vitest 4, React Testing Library 16, Playwright 1.58  
**Storage**: Stateless; no database or persistent server storage  
**Testing**: Vitest + React Testing Library (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E), manual verification  
**Target Platform**: Vercel-hosted Next.js web app, modern desktop/mobile browsers  
**Project Type**: Web application with server-side API routes and client-side analysis UI  
**Performance Goals**: Opening an org inventory, filtering rows, sorting columns, changing visible columns, adjusting the bulk-selection slider, and selecting repositories for analysis must remain local UI work after the inventory response returns; no extra org fetches for local table interactions  
**Constraints**: Use verified public GitHub metadata only; do not run full CHAOSS analysis for every repo in the org inventory view; reuse existing repo-analysis flows for single-repo and multi-repo drill-in; keep the bulk-selection cap config-driven with a default max of `5`; support ascending/descending sort on every visible column; keep `Repository` pinned as a visible column; keep mobile table scanning usable via responsive layout and horizontal overflow when needed  
**Scale/Scope**: org input normalization, org inventory API route/queries, summary rollups, configurable-column sortable/filterable table, slider-limited repo selection, drill-in to existing repo analysis, tests/manual checklist/docs

## Constitution Check

| Rule | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| I / Phase 1 stack | PASS | Remains within the existing Next.js / React / Tailwind stack |
| II / Honest data only | PASS | Inventory rows and org rollups use verified public metadata or explicit unavailable states only |
| III / Shared analyzer outputs | PASS | Reuses the existing repo-analysis flow for drill-in instead of creating a second deep-analysis path |
| V / CHAOSS alignment | PASS | This feature is an inventory/discovery surface and does not alter the existing CHAOSS dimension contracts |
| VI / Config-driven thresholds | PASS | The bulk-selection limit is config-driven rather than hardcoded in the UI |
| IX / Feature scope rules | PASS | Scope stays within lightweight org inventory, local table behavior, and repo-analysis handoff |
| XI — TDD mandatory | PASS | Inventory parsing, sorting, filtering, visible-column state, selection-limit logic, and drill-in behavior will require focused tests |
| XII / XIII — DoD and workflow | PASS | Manual checklist and follow-on tasks will be created before implementation completes |

**Gate result**: PASS — no constitution violations identified.

## Implementation Sequence

### Phase 0 — Research

1. Confirm the best GitHub query shape for fetching public repositories, archived status, languages, stars, forks, watchers, issue counts, and pushed timestamps without deep per-repo analysis
2. Confirm how org-level pagination should work for larger organizations in Phase 1 and where to stop if virtualization/pagination is needed
3. Decide the default visible-column set for desktop and mobile while keeping `Repository` pinned
4. Decide deterministic behavior when the selection-limit slider is lowered below the current selected count
5. Confirm the fallback sort behavior when a currently sorted column is hidden
6. Confirm the simplest repo-analysis handoff from org inventory into the existing multi-repo analysis flow

### Phase 1 — Design

6. Define the org inventory data model for request input, repo rows, summary rollups, filter state, sort state, selection state, and rate-limit metadata
7. Define the UI contract for org input, summary cards, table columns, visible-column controls, per-column asc/desc sort behavior, filter controls, and selection-limit slider
8. Define the bulk-analysis handoff contract so selected repos move cleanly into the existing repo-analysis flow without duplicating submission logic
9. Create the manual testing checklist for valid orgs, invalid orgs, empty orgs, local filtering/sorting, visible-column changes, selection-limit enforcement, mobile usability, and drill-in behavior

### Phase 2 — Implementation Preview

10. Add a lightweight server-side org inventory endpoint and shaping logic for public repository metadata
11. Introduce shared config for the default/max bulk-selection limit and shared local helpers for filtering, sorting, visible-column selection, and summary rollups
12. Build the org inventory workspace with summary area, filters, visible-column controls, slider, table, and row/bulk analyze actions
13. Connect row-level and multi-select analysis actions into the existing repo-analysis flow without creating a second analysis implementation path
14. Add unit/integration/E2E coverage for sorting every visible column, local filters, visible-column state, slider-limit enforcement, empty/error states, and repo-analysis handoff

## Complexity Tracking

No constitution violations. No complexity justification required.
