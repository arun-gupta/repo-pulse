# Feature Specification: Metric Cards

**Feature Branch**: `008-metric-cards`  
**Created**: 2026-04-01  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "P1-F07 Metric Cards"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Scan key repo health signals quickly (Priority: P1)

A user can see one summary card per successfully analyzed repository so the most important repo signals are readable at a glance without switching tabs or opening a comparison table.

**Why this priority**: This is the first user-facing summary layer for per-repo analysis and gives immediate value even before deeper score features are fully implemented.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by supplying one or more successful `AnalysisResult` objects and confirming one card appears per repo with stars, forks, watches, created date, and the current ecosystem profile summary.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** one successful repository has been analyzed, **When** the overview is shown, **Then** one summary card appears for that repo with stars, forks, watches, created date, and ecosystem profile summary.
2. **Given** multiple successful repositories have been analyzed, **When** the overview is shown, **Then** one summary card appears for each successful repository.
3. **Given** one or more repositories failed during analysis, **When** the overview is shown, **Then** only successful repositories produce summary cards and failed repositories do not create fabricated card content.

### User Story 2 - Understand CHAOSS-aligned score badges per repo (Priority: P2)

A user can see one score badge per CHAOSS category on each repo card so the repo’s health framing is visible without opening the detailed metrics views.

**Why this priority**: The metric cards become much more useful when they summarize the cross-category health framing, but they still depend on the earlier card shell being present first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering repo cards with score values for Evolution, Sustainability, and Responsiveness and confirming the badges show the expected labels and color semantics, including the interim `Not scored yet` state before later scoring features land.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a repo card is rendered with Evolution, Sustainability, and Responsiveness scores, **When** the user views the card, **Then** one badge appears for each CHAOSS-aligned dimension.
2. **Given** a score badge is shown, **When** the user inspects it, **Then** the CHAOSS category label is displayed alongside or beneath the score so the framing is explicit.
3. **Given** score values of High, Medium, Low, or Not scored yet exist, **When** badges are rendered, **Then** they use a consistent visual treatment that matches the score semantics.

### User Story 3 - Expand a card to inspect missing-data detail (Priority: P3)

A user can click or expand a repo card to reveal missing-data detail for that repository without duplicating the deeper metric views that belong in later tabs.

**Why this priority**: Expansion is still useful for transparency around unavailable data, but it should not compete with the dedicated metrics views that follow.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by rendering a repo card with missing fields, expanding it, and confirming the missing-data detail becomes visible while the rest of the analysis workspace remains intact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a repo summary card has unavailable fields, **When** the user expands the card, **Then** a missing-data detail panel becomes visible in place.
2. **Given** a repo card is expanded, **When** the user returns it to its collapsed state, **Then** the summary card remains intact and no analysis request is rerun.
3. **Given** a repo has unavailable metrics, **When** the expanded detail is shown, **Then** unavailable values remain explicitly marked rather than hidden or guessed.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when no successful repositories exist in the current analysis?
- What happens when a repo card must show score badges before later features have full scoring logic available?
- What happens when a repo contains unavailable values for fields shown in the card or expanded detail?
- What happens when multiple repo cards are expanded in a mobile-width layout?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST render one summary card per successful repository in the current analysis.
- **FR-002**: Each summary card MUST show exact stars, forks, watches, created date, and ecosystem profile summary for that repository.
- **FR-003**: Ecosystem profile badges on the card MUST use consistent visual treatment across Reach, Builder Engagement, and Attention tiers.
- **FR-004**: Each summary card MUST surface one badge for each CHAOSS-aligned dimension represented by later scoring features: Evolution, Sustainability, and Responsiveness.
- **FR-005**: Score badge colors MUST map consistently to High, Medium, Low, and Not scored yet.
- **FR-006**: Each score badge MUST display the associated CHAOSS category label so the framing is always visible.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to click or expand a repo card to reveal missing-data detail for that repository when unavailable fields exist.
- **FR-008**: Expanding or collapsing a repo card MUST NOT rerun the analysis request or trigger extra API calls.
- **FR-009**: Failed repositories MUST NOT render summary cards.
- **FR-010**: Unavailable metrics shown in the card or expanded detail MUST remain explicit and MUST NOT be hidden, zeroed, or guessed.

### Key Entities

- **Repo Summary Card**: The overview-level UI representation of one successful repository with key metrics, ecosystem profile badges, and CHAOSS score badges.
- **Score Badge**: A compact, color-coded UI element representing one CHAOSS category score and label.
- **Expanded Repo Detail**: The additional in-place card content that appears when a repo card is expanded to explain missing or unavailable fields.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: For analyses with one or more successful repositories, 100% of successful repositories render exactly one summary card in the overview.
- **SC-002**: For rendered score badges, 100% of badges show both the score value and CHAOSS category label with consistent color semantics.
- **SC-003**: Users can expand a repo card and view missing-data detail without triggering additional analysis requests.
- **SC-004**: Unavailable values shown in cards or expanded details remain explicit in 100% of tested missing-data scenarios.

## Assumptions

- `P1-F05 Ecosystem Map` already provides the ecosystem profile summary values that metric cards can reuse.
- Full score computation for Evolution, Sustainability, and Responsiveness may be implemented incrementally, but the card contract should be ready to host those badges consistently.
- The cards live within the existing `P1-F15` results shell rather than introducing a new page layout.
- Comparison-table behavior remains out of scope for this feature and will still be handled later by `P1-F06`.
