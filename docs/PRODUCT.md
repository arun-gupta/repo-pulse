# ForkPrint — Product Definition

**Repo**: `arun-gupta/forkprint`  
**Description**: CHAOSS-aligned GitHub repository health analyzer. Accepts one or more `owner/repo` inputs, fetches real public data via the GitHub GraphQL API, and produces an interactive dashboard and raw JSON output.  
**Phase 1 Platform**: Next.js deployed on Vercel  
**Phase 1 Data Layer**: Next.js API Routes  
**Development Methodology**: SpecKit / Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

This document is the canonical product definition for ForkPrint. It is the source of truth for all features across all phases. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` references this document. SpecKit specs are traceable to feature IDs defined here.

---

## Roadmap

ForkPrint is built in three phases. Phase 1 architectural decisions must not block Phases 2 or 3.

- **Phase 1** — Web app (Next.js / Vercel): interactive dashboard for on-demand repo analysis
- **Phase 2** — GitHub Action: scheduled or triggered analysis with artifact output and threshold alerting
- **Phase 3** — MCP Server: exposes analysis as a tool callable by AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.)

The core analysis logic is shared across all three phases via a framework-agnostic analyzer module. No phase duplicates it.

---

## Data Source

**GitHub GraphQL API** (`https://api.github.com/graphql`) is the primary data source.

- Fetches all required metrics in 1–3 requests per repo vs. 10–15 REST calls
- Precise field selection — no over-fetching
- Single auth mechanism: Personal Access Token (classic), minimum `public_repo` read-only scope
- REST API may supplement only where GraphQL cannot reach a specific metric
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is always read from environment — never hardcoded

---

## CHAOSS Alignment

ForkPrint groups analysis into four CHAOSS-aligned reporting dimensions. These dimensions are product-level buckets, not a claim that they are the official top-level CHAOSS metric taxonomy.

| ForkPrint Dimension | CHAOSS Basis | Feature | Derived Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ecosystem | ForkPrint repo-profile layer informed by CHAOSS-style ecosystem signals | Ecosystem Map (P1-F05) | Ecosystem profile: Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention |
| Evolution | CHAOSS Evolution metrics and focus areas | Evolution (P1-F08) | Evolution score: High / Medium / Low |
| Sustainability | Contribution and organizational resilience metrics aligned with CHAOSS contributor/community health work | Contribution Dynamics (P1-F09) | Resilience score: High / Medium / Low |
| Responsiveness | CHAOSS-aligned time-to-response and time-to-resolution metrics | Responsiveness (P1-F10) | Responsiveness score: High / Medium / Low |

Scores are assigned only when sufficient verified data exists. Otherwise: `"Insufficient verified public data"`.

---

## Accuracy Policy

- Every metric must come from a verified public GitHub GraphQL API response
- No estimation, interpolation, inference, or fabrication — ever
- Missing data is acceptable and marked `"unavailable"` — invented precision is not
- Never substitute one metric for another
- Organizational diversity is surfaced as `"Could not verify contributor organization publicly"` when not inferable — never approximated

---

## Phase 1 — Web App (Next.js / Vercel)

### Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Deployment**: Vercel — zero-config
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Spectrum/profile UI via React components
- **Stateless** — no database, no auth system, all analysis is on-demand

### API Contract

```
POST /api/analyze
Body:     { "repos": ["owner/repo", ...], "token"?: "ghp_..." }
Response: { "results": AnalysisResult[] }
```

Server-side token (`GITHUB_TOKEN` env var) takes precedence. If absent, token is supplied client-side from `localStorage`. Token is never included in URLs or exposed to the client bundle.

### Pages

- `/` — repo input form and token entry
- `/dashboard` — ecosystem map, metric cards, analysis results, export controls

---

## Planned Features

Each feature is the unit of a SpecKit spec — one feature maps to one spec file. Acceptance criteria define the testable surface. Features are behavioral contracts, not implementation tasks.

---

### Phase 1 — Web App

---

#### `[P1-F01]` Repo Input

User can provide one or more GitHub repositories for analysis.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Textarea accepts one `owner/repo` slug per line, or comma-separated, or full GitHub URLs (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) — slug is extracted automatically
- Client-side validation rejects malformed slugs before submission (`owner/repo` pattern, trims whitespace)
- Empty submission is blocked with an inline error
- Duplicate slugs are removed client-side before passing to the data fetching layer
- Valid input is passed to the data fetching layer unchanged

**Out of scope**
- Saving or persisting repo lists across sessions
- Browsing or searching GitHub repos from within the UI

---

#### `[P1-F02]` Authentication

User can authenticate with GitHub to enable data fetching.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Token input field accepts a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Token is stored in `localStorage` — never transmitted anywhere except the GitHub GraphQL API
- UI displays the minimum required scope: `public_repo` read-only
- Missing token with no server-side fallback blocks submission with a clear error

**Out of scope**
- Multi-account or org-level token management
- OAuth flow is handled by P1-F14

---

#### `[P1-F03]` Deployment

ForkPrint deploys to Vercel with minimal configuration.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Deployable to Vercel with zero config
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` configurable as a Vercel environment variable for shared/team deployments
- When `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set as a Vercel environment variable, it is used server-side and the token input field is hidden in the UI
- No database, no auth system — stateless by default
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` never exposed to the client bundle

**Out of scope**
- Self-hosted Docker deployment (not blocked, just not documented in Phase 1)
- Multi-region or edge deployment configuration

---

#### `[P1-F04]` Data Fetching

The analyzer fetches exact, verified metric data from GitHub for each repo.

**Acceptance criteria**
- All data fetched via GitHub GraphQL API in 1–3 requests per repo
- Next.js API Route (`/api/analyze`) proxies GraphQL requests server-side
- Per-repo error isolation: one failed repo does not block results for others
- Rate limit state is surfaced to the user (remaining calls, `Retry-After` when exhausted)
- Loading state shown per repo during fetch
- No metric is estimated, inferred, or fabricated — missing fields are marked `"unavailable"`
- Data fetched per repo covers the following placeholders:
  - **Repo metadata**: name, description, created date, primary language
  - **Ecosystem signals**: stars, forks, watchers
  - **Evolution**: commits (last 30d, last 90d), releases (last 12mo), PRs opened (last 90d), PRs merged (last 90d), issues open, issues closed (last 90d)
  - **Contribution Dynamics**: unique commit authors (last 90d), total contributors, commit counts per author
  - **Responsiveness**: issue first-response timestamps, issue close timestamps, PR merge timestamps

**Out of scope**
- Caching or persisting fetched data
- Webhook-triggered or scheduled fetching (Phase 2)

---

#### `[P1-F05]` Ecosystem Map

Repos are summarized in an interactive ecosystem view with a spectrum-based ecosystem profile.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Each successful repo surfaces an ecosystem profile with three tiered dimensions:
  - Reach
  - Builder Engagement
  - Attention
- Spectrum bands are defined in shared config and rendered consistently in the UI; component logic must not hardcode the thresholds independently
- Each successful repo card shows exact stars / forks / watches plus derived fork rate and watcher rate where they are verifiable
- Single-repo input remains fully useful: the repo is still profiled without requiring a comparison set
- Repos with unavailable ecosystem metrics are never given fabricated rates or derived profile tiers

**Out of scope**
- Saving or sharing a generated visualization directly
- Animating transitions between analyses

---

#### `[P1-F15]` Results Shell

ForkPrint presents analysis in a stable app shell so users can submit repos once and switch between result views cleanly.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A top header/banner shows the ForkPrint brand and a visible GitHub repo link
- Repo input and Analyze action live in a stable analysis panel that remains visible above the result views
- Successful analyses populate a tabbed result area rather than stacking every future view vertically
- The shell organizes result views in a stable order with `Overview` first and domain views such as `Metrics`, `Responsiveness`, `Sustainability`, and `Comparison` available as tabs
- The `Overview` tab is the first populated results tab and can absorb cross-feature summary content until later tabs deliver distinct value
- Switching tabs does not re-submit the analysis request or trigger extra API calls
- The shell works for single-repo and multi-repo analyses on desktop and mobile layouts

**Out of scope**
- Persisting the selected tab across sessions
- Replacing later feature-specific behavior inside each tab
- User-customizable tab sets or dashboard layout editing

---

#### `[P1-F06]` Repo Comparison

Users can compare two or more repos side by side across all health metrics.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Any analysis of 2+ repos surfaces a comparison view alongside the individual repo cards
- Comparison table shows all metrics in rows, repos in columns — delta values highlighted where meaningful
- Metrics unavailable for one repo are shown as `—` in that column, never omitted from the row
- Comparison is driven entirely from the already-fetched `AnalysisResult[]` — no additional API calls
- All metric categories represented: ecosystem signals, evolution, contribution dynamics, responsiveness, health ratios
- Comparison view is exportable as JSON and Markdown alongside individual repo exports

**Design constraints** *(inform all upstream features)*
- `AnalysisResult` schema must be flat and consistent enough to diff across repos without transformation — design this from the start
- Ecosystem profile summaries are the visual entry point into comparison; the comparison table is the detail layer
- UI layout must accommodate 2–6 repos in comparison without horizontal scroll on desktop viewports

**Out of scope**
- Saving or naming a comparison set
- Diffing snapshots across time (Future — `FUT-F01`)
- More than 6 repos in a single comparison

---

#### `[P1-F07]` Metric Cards

Each repo is summarized in a scannable card showing key health signals.

**Acceptance criteria**
- One card per repo displaying: stars, forks, watches, created date, ecosystem profile summary (Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention), and one score badge per CHAOSS-aligned dimension (Evolution, Sustainability, Responsiveness)
- Ecosystem profile badges use consistent visual treatment across Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention tiers
- Score badge colors: High = green, Medium = amber, Low = red, Insufficient = gray — consistent across all three CHAOSS score badges
- CHAOSS category label shown beneath each score badge so the framing is always visible
- Card click or expand reveals missing-data detail for that repo without duplicating the deeper metric views hosted in later tabs

**Out of scope**
- Pinning or reordering cards
- Inline side-by-side card layout — comparison detail is handled by P1-F06

---

#### `[P1-F08]` Evolution *(CHAOSS: Evolution)*

The analyzer measures how a repo's activity has changed over time.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Metrics computed: commits in last 30d, commits in last 90d, releases in last 12 months, PRs opened in last 90d, PRs merged in last 90d, PR merge rate (merged / opened), open issues, closed issues in last 90d, stale issue ratio (open > 90d / total open)
- Evolution score — High / Medium / Low — assigned only when sufficient verified data exists; otherwise surfaces `Insufficient verified public data`
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- UI exposes thresholds via a "how is this scored?" tooltip
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI

**Out of scope**
- User-adjustable thresholds in the UI (Future backlog)
- Commit frequency broken down by day of week or time of day

---

#### `[P1-F09]` Contribution Dynamics *(ForkPrint Sustainability Dimension)*

The analyzer measures the depth, distribution, and sustainability of contributor activity.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Metrics computed: active contributors in last 90d (unique commit authors), total contributors, new contributors (first commit in last 90d), repeat contributors, contribution concentration (% of commits from top 20% of authors)
- Organizational diversity surfaced using two explicit measures when public data allows it: verified organization count and largest-organization share among verifiable active contributors
- If contributor organization cannot be verified publicly with enough confidence, the UI surfaces `Could not verify contributor organization publicly` rather than approximating
- Resilience score — High / Medium / Low — derived from contribution dynamics data; assigned only when concentration data is verifiable
- Scoring logic: high concentration + dominant org share = fragile; high concentration + multiple orgs = moderate; distributed contributors + distributed org share = strong; unknown org data lowers confidence and may block scoring
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI
- Missing data explicitly listed in the per-repo callout panel

**Out of scope**
- Manually overriding org affiliation
- Bus Factor calculation (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P1-F10]` Responsiveness *(CHAOSS: Responsiveness)*

The analyzer measures how quickly maintainers engage with community activity.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Metrics computed: median time to first issue response, median time to close issues, median time to merge PRs
- Computed from exact timestamps in GraphQL issue and PR event data — no estimation
- Responsiveness score — High / Medium / Low — assigned only when sufficient event data exists; otherwise surfaces `Insufficient verified public data`
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- If GitHub does not surface required event timestamps via GraphQL, fields are marked `"unavailable"` and called out explicitly in the missing data panel
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI

**Out of scope**
- First response time broken down by label or contributor type
- SLA tracking over time (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P1-F11]` Health Ratios

Computed diagnostic ratios provide a quick cross-repo comparison surface, drawn from all four CHAOSS categories.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Ecosystem ratios: forks/stars, watches/stars
- Evolution ratios: merged PRs/opened PRs, stale issues/total open issues
- Contribution Dynamics ratios: repeat contributors/total contributors, new contributors/total contributors
- Unavailable ratios displayed as `—`, never estimated
- Ratios grouped by CHAOSS category in the UI
- Table is sortable by ratio value across repos
- Ratios computed only from verified API values

**Out of scope**
- Custom ratio definitions by the user

---

#### `[P1-F12]` Missing Data & Accuracy

The UI makes data gaps explicit and never hides them.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Per-repo callout panel lists every field that could not be verified from the API
- Fields marked unavailable in the JSON output are visually distinguished in the UI (not hidden, not zeroed out)
- No metric is estimated, inferred, or substituted — enforced in the analyzer module and visible in the UI

**Out of scope**
- Suggesting alternative data sources for missing fields

---

#### `[P1-F14]` GitHub OAuth Authentication

User can authenticate with GitHub via OAuth instead of manually entering a PAT.

**Acceptance criteria**
- "Sign in with GitHub" button initiates the OAuth flow using a registered GitHub OAuth App
- OAuth access token is stored in `localStorage` — same storage contract as PAT
- OAuth token has the same minimum required scope: `public_repo` read-only
- After successful OAuth login, the token input field is replaced with a signed-in indicator showing the GitHub username
- User can sign out, which clears the stored OAuth token from `localStorage`
- If a server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` is configured, the OAuth flow is hidden (same behavior as P1-F02)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` are stored as environment variables — never committed, never sent to the client
- OAuth callback is handled server-side; the access token is never exposed in the URL

**Out of scope**
- Multi-account or org-level OAuth management
- Token refresh / long-lived session management (Phase 1 is stateless)
- Replacing PAT support — PAT and OAuth coexist; PAT remains available for users who prefer it

---

#### `[P1-F13]` Export

Users can take analysis results out of the UI in standard formats.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Download full `AnalysisResult[]` as JSON
- Download summary as Markdown report (CHAOSS-aligned format)
- Copy shareable URL that encodes the repo list as query params — token never included in the URL

**Out of scope**
- PDF export
- CSV export
- Saved reports or report history (Future backlog)

---

### Phase 2 — GitHub Action

---

#### `[P2-F01]` Scheduled Analysis

ForkPrint runs as a GitHub Action on a schedule or manual trigger.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Action supports `schedule` (cron) and `workflow_dispatch` triggers
- Repo list supplied as action input: multiline string or JSON array
- Imports `analyze()` directly from the shared analyzer module — no logic duplication
- Outputs JSON artifact uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts
- Optional Markdown summary posted as a GitHub Actions job summary
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` consumed from the action's built-in secret — no extra setup for public repos

**Out of scope**
- Push or release event triggers (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P2-F02]` Threshold Alerting

The action can open a GitHub Issue when health drops below a defined threshold.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Optional step: opens a GitHub Issue if any CHAOSS score falls below configured threshold
- Issue body includes the Markdown health report
- Threshold values sourced from the shared config — not hardcoded in the workflow

**Out of scope**
- Slack or email notifications (Future backlog)

---

### Phase 3 — MCP Server

---

#### `[P3-F01]` Analyze Tool

ForkPrint exposes repo health analysis as an MCP tool callable by AI assistants.

**Acceptance criteria**
- MCP Server exposes an `analyze_repo` tool
- Tool accepts: `repos: string[]`, optional `token?: string`
- Tool returns a typed `AnalysisResult` object matching the shared analyzer output contract
- Wraps `analyze()` from the shared analyzer module — no logic duplication
- Usable from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant

**Out of scope**
- Streaming partial results during analysis
- Tool for adjusting scoring thresholds

---

#### `[P3-F02]` Deployment & Integration Docs

The MCP Server is deployable and documented for common AI assistant setups.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Deployable as a standalone Node.js process
- Deployable as a Vercel serverless function
- README section documents how to connect to Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` passed via environment variable — never hardcoded

**Out of scope**
- GUI for configuring the MCP server

---

### Future / Backlog

Not specced. Captured here so Phase 1–3 decisions don't foreclose them.

- `[FUT-F01]` **Historical trending** — store snapshots over time, chart metric trajectory per repo
- `[FUT-F02]` **Org-level view** — analyze all public repos under a GitHub org in one pass
- `[FUT-F03]` **CHAOSS expansion** — Bus Factor, Change Request Closure Ratio, Code Coverage metrics
- `[FUT-F04]` **Embeddable badge** — `![ForkPrint Health](https://forkprint.vercel.app/badge/owner/repo)` for READMEs
- `[FUT-F05]` **Webhook mode** — trigger analysis on push or release events via GitHub webhook
