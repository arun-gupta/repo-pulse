# RepoPulse — Product Definition

**Repo**: `arun-gupta/repo-pulse`  
**Description**: CHAOSS-aligned GitHub repository health analyzer. Accepts one or more `owner/repo` inputs, fetches real public data via the GitHub GraphQL API, and produces an interactive dashboard and raw JSON output.  
**Phase 1 Platform**: Next.js deployed on Vercel  
**Phase 1 Data Layer**: Next.js API Routes  
**Development Methodology**: SpecKit / Specification-Driven Development (SDD)

This document is the canonical product definition for RepoPulse. It is the source of truth for all features across all phases. `.specify/memory/constitution.md` references this document. SpecKit specs are traceable to feature IDs defined here.

---

## Roadmap

RepoPulse is built in four phases. Phase 1 architectural decisions must not block Phases 2, 3, or 4.

- **Phase 1** — Web app (Next.js / Vercel): interactive dashboard for on-demand repo analysis
- **Phase 2** — GitHub Action: scheduled or triggered analysis with artifact output and threshold alerting
- **Phase 3** — MCP Server: exposes analysis as a tool callable by AI assistants (Claude, Cursor, etc.)
- **Phase 4** — GitLab support: port the analyzer, data fetching, and auth layers to work with GitLab in addition to GitHub, across all delivery phases (P1, P2, P3)

The core analysis logic is shared across all phases via a framework-agnostic analyzer module. No phase duplicates it. Phase 4 introduces a provider abstraction so GitHub and GitLab data sources are interchangeable.

---

## Data Source

**GitHub GraphQL API** (`https://api.github.com/graphql`) is the primary data source.

- Fetches all required metrics in 1–3 requests per repo vs. 10–15 REST calls
- Precise field selection — no over-fetching
- Single auth mechanism: GitHub Personal Access Token with repository read access sufficient for the required GraphQL and REST calls
- REST API may supplement only where GraphQL cannot reach a specific metric
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` is always read from environment — never hardcoded

---

## CHAOSS Alignment

RepoPulse groups analysis into four CHAOSS-aligned reporting dimensions. These dimensions are product-level buckets, not a claim that they are the official top-level CHAOSS metric taxonomy.

| RepoPulse Dimension | CHAOSS Basis | Feature | Derived Score |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ecosystem | RepoPulse repo-profile layer informed by CHAOSS-style ecosystem signals | Ecosystem Map (P1-F05) | Ecosystem profile: Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention |
| Activity | CHAOSS-aligned activity and adjacent activity-flow signals | Activity (P1-F08) | Activity score: High / Medium / Low |
| Contributors | Contributor metrics with a dedicated Sustainability pane for resilience and organizational-risk signals | Contributors (P1-F09) | Core contributor metrics + Sustainability score |
| Responsiveness | CHAOSS-aligned time-to-response and time-to-resolution metrics | Responsiveness (P1-F10) | Responsiveness score: High / Medium / Low |

Scores are assigned only when sufficient verified data exists. Otherwise: `"Insufficient verified public data"`.

---

## Accuracy Policy

- Every metric must come from a verified public GitHub GraphQL API response
- No estimation, interpolation, inference, or fabrication — ever
- Missing data is acceptable and marked `"unavailable"` — invented precision is not
- Never substitute one metric for another
- Organizational diversity is surfaced as `"Could not verify contributor organization publicly"` when not inferable — never approximated

---

## Phase 1 — Web App (Next.js / Vercel)

### Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- **Deployment**: Vercel — zero-config
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Visualization**: Spectrum/profile UI via React components
- **Stateless** — no database, no auth system, all analysis is on-demand

### API Contract

```
POST /api/analyze
Body:     { "repos": ["owner/repo", ...], "token"?: "ghp_..." }
Response: { "results": AnalysisResult[] }

POST /api/analyze-org
Body:     { "org": "github-org", "token"?: "ghp_..." }
Response: { "org": "github-org", "results": OrgRepoSummary[] }
```

Server-side token (`GITHUB_TOKEN` env var) takes precedence. If absent, token is supplied client-side from `localStorage`. Token is never included in URLs or exposed to the client bundle.

### Pages

- `/` — repo input form and token entry
- `/dashboard` — ecosystem map, metric cards, analysis results, export controls

---

## Planned Features

Each feature is the unit of a SpecKit spec — one feature maps to one spec file. Acceptance criteria define the testable surface. Features are behavioral contracts, not implementation tasks.

---

### Phase 1 — Web App

---

#### `[P1-F01]` Repo Input

User can provide one or more GitHub repositories for analysis.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Textarea accepts one `owner/repo` slug per line, or comma-separated, or full GitHub URLs (`https://github.com/owner/repo`) — slug is extracted automatically
- Client-side validation rejects malformed slugs before submission (`owner/repo` pattern, trims whitespace)
- Empty submission is blocked with an inline error
- Duplicate slugs are removed client-side before passing to the data fetching layer
- Valid input is passed to the data fetching layer unchanged

**Out of scope**
- Saving or persisting repo lists across sessions
- Browsing or searching GitHub repos from within the UI

---

#### `[P1-F16]` Org-Level Repo Inventory

User can provide a GitHub organization and get a high-level inventory of its public repositories.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Input accepts a top-level GitHub org slug or GitHub org URL and normalizes it to the org name before submission
- App fetches the org's public repositories using public GitHub metadata only
- Results render in a sortable table with one row per repo
- Every visible column supports ascending and descending local sorting without rerunning the org request
- Table includes at least: repository name, description, primary language, stars, forks, watchers, open issues count, last pushed date, and repo URL
- Users can choose which optional columns are visible while `Repository` remains pinned
- Table supports lightweight filtering by repo name, language, and archived status
- Large org inventories support local pagination controls with configurable rows per page
- Org-level summary area shows high-level rollups such as total public repos, total stars, most-starred repos, most recently active repos, language distribution, and archived vs active repo count
- Each repo row links into the existing repo-level analysis flow so users can drill into a specific repository
- Users can select multiple repositories from the org inventory table and launch the existing repo-analysis flow for that selection, up to the configured bulk-selection limit
- Empty orgs, invalid orgs, and rate-limit states are handled clearly without fabricating results

**Design constraints**
- This is a high-level organization inventory view, not a full CHAOSS analysis computed for every repo in the org
- Phase 1 implementation stays within lightweight public metadata and should avoid expensive per-repo deep fetches by default
- Table layout must remain usable on desktop and mobile, with pagination or virtualization available for large orgs

**Out of scope**
- Analyzing private repositories
- Running the full per-repo metric pipeline automatically for every repo in an org
- Historical org snapshots or trend charts
- Cross-org comparison

---

#### `[P1-F02]` Authentication

User can authenticate with GitHub to enable data fetching.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Token input field accepts a GitHub Personal Access Token
- Token is stored in `localStorage` — never transmitted anywhere except the GitHub GraphQL API
- UI displays the required token guidance for supported GitHub auth
- Missing token with no server-side fallback blocks submission with a clear error

**Out of scope**
- Multi-account or org-level token management
- OAuth flow is handled by P1-F14

---

#### `[P1-F03]` Deployment

RepoPulse deploys to Vercel with minimal configuration.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Deployable to Vercel with zero config
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` configurable as a Vercel environment variable for shared/team deployments
- When `GITHUB_TOKEN` is set as a Vercel environment variable, it is used server-side and the token input field is hidden in the UI
- No database, no auth system — stateless by default
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` never exposed to the client bundle

**Out of scope**
- Self-hosted Docker deployment (not blocked, just not documented in Phase 1)
- Multi-region or edge deployment configuration

---

#### `[P1-F04]` Data Fetching

The analyzer fetches exact, verified metric data from GitHub for each repo.

**Acceptance criteria**
- All data fetched via GitHub GraphQL API in 1–3 requests per repo
- Next.js API Route (`/api/analyze`) proxies GraphQL requests server-side
- Per-repo error isolation: one failed repo does not block results for others
- Rate limit state is surfaced to the user (remaining calls, `Retry-After` when exhausted)
- Loading state shown per repo during fetch
- No metric is estimated, inferred, or fabricated — missing fields are marked `"unavailable"`
- Data fetched per repo covers the following placeholders:
  - **Repo metadata**: name, description, created date, primary language
  - **Ecosystem signals**: stars, forks, watchers
  - **Activity**: commits (last 30d, last 90d, last 180d), releases (last 12mo), PRs opened / merged / closed, issues opened / closed, and contributor-activity flow timing where specified
  - **Contributors**: unique commit authors (last 90d), total contributors, commit counts per author
  - **Responsiveness**: issue first-response timestamps, issue close timestamps, PR merge timestamps

**Out of scope**
- Caching or persisting fetched data
- Webhook-triggered or scheduled fetching (Phase 2)

---

#### `[P1-F05]` Ecosystem Map

Repos are summarized in an interactive ecosystem view with a spectrum-based ecosystem profile.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Each successful repo surfaces an ecosystem profile with three tiered dimensions:
  - Reach
  - Builder Engagement
  - Attention
- Spectrum bands are defined in shared config and rendered consistently in the UI; component logic must not hardcode the thresholds independently
- Each successful repo card shows exact stars / forks / watches plus derived fork rate and watcher rate where they are verifiable
- Single-repo input remains fully useful: the repo is still profiled without requiring a comparison set
- Repos with unavailable ecosystem metrics are never given fabricated rates or derived profile tiers

**Out of scope**
- Saving or sharing a generated visualization directly
- Animating transitions between analyses

---

#### `[P1-F15]` Results Shell

RepoPulse presents analysis in a stable app shell so users can submit repos once and switch between result views cleanly.

**Acceptance criteria**
- A top header/banner shows the RepoPulse brand and a visible GitHub repo link
- Repo input and Analyze action live in a stable analysis panel that remains visible above the result views
- Successful analyses populate a tabbed result area rather than stacking every future view vertically
- The shell organizes result views in a stable order with `Overview` first and domain views such as `Contributors`, `Activity`, `Responsiveness`, `Health Ratios`, and `Comparison` available as tabs
- The `Overview` tab is the first populated results tab and can absorb cross-feature summary content until later tabs deliver distinct value
- Switching tabs does not re-submit the analysis request or trigger extra API calls
- The shell works for single-repo and multi-repo analyses on desktop and mobile layouts

**Out of scope**
- Persisting the selected tab across sessions
- Replacing later feature-specific behavior inside each tab
- User-customizable tab sets or dashboard layout editing

---

#### `[P1-F06]` Repo Comparison

Users can compare two or more repos side by side across all health metrics.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Repository input exposes both `Analyze` and `Compare` actions in repo mode, both backed by the same analysis request
- `Compare` is available only when at least two valid repos are entered and no more than four repos are eligible for comparison
- Any analysis of 2+ repos surfaces a comparison view alongside the individual repo cards
- Choosing `Compare` opens the results workspace directly on `Comparison` after analysis completes
- Comparison table shows selected metrics in rows, repos in columns, with comparison-focused delta messaging highlighted more prominently than raw values
- Comparison view uses a user-selectable anchor repo as the baseline for delta interpretation; the first mentioned successful repo is the default anchor
- Comparison table is organized into clearly labeled sections such as Overview, Contributors, Activity, Responsiveness, and Health Ratios
- Users can enable or disable entire comparison sections, with all sections enabled by default
- Users can choose which comparison attributes are shown; all supported attributes are selected by default
- Comparison view includes a user-selectable median column across the chosen repos; it is visible by default
- Every visible comparison column is sortable in ascending or descending order within the current section context
- The UI clearly communicates the maximum of 4 compared repositories before and during analysis input
- Metrics unavailable for one repo are shown as `—` in that column, never omitted from the row
- Comparison is driven entirely from the already-fetched `AnalysisResult[]` — no additional API calls
- All metric categories represented: ecosystem signals, activity, contribution dynamics, responsiveness, health ratios
- Comparison view is exportable as JSON and Markdown alongside individual repo exports

**Design constraints** *(inform all upstream features)*
- `AnalysisResult` schema must be flat and consistent enough to diff across repos without transformation — design this from the start
- Ecosystem profile summaries are the visual entry point into comparison; the comparison table is the detail layer
- UI layout must accommodate 2–4 repos in comparison without horizontal scroll on desktop viewports
- The anchor model should make "better or worse than the baseline" easier to understand than a neutral spreadsheet alone

**Out of scope**
- Saving or naming a comparison set
- Diffing snapshots across time (Future — `FUT-F01`)
- More than 4 repos in a single comparison

---

#### `[P1-F07]` Metric Cards

Each repo is summarized in a scannable card showing key health signals.

**Acceptance criteria**
- One card per repo displaying: stars, forks, watches, created date, ecosystem profile summary (Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention), and one score badge per CHAOSS-aligned dimension (Activity, Sustainability, Responsiveness)
- Ecosystem profile badges use consistent visual treatment across Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention tiers
- Score badge colors: High = green, Medium = amber, Low = red, Insufficient = gray — consistent across all three CHAOSS score badges
- CHAOSS category label shown beneath each score badge so the framing is always visible
- Card click or expand reveals missing-data detail for that repo without duplicating the deeper metric views hosted in later tabs

**Out of scope**
- Pinning or reordering cards
- Inline side-by-side card layout — comparison detail is handled by P1-F06

---

#### `[P1-F08]` Activity *(CHAOSS-aligned: activity flow)*

The analyzer measures how a repo's recent activity and delivery flow change across configurable recent windows.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Metrics computed:
  - commits over time in `30d`, `90d`, and `180d` windows
  - PR throughput: opened, merged, closed
  - issue flow: opened, closed
  - release cadence and version frequency
  - PR merge rate (`merged / opened`)
  - issue closure rate (`closed / opened`) for the selected window
  - stale issue ratio (`open older than selected window / total open`)
  - median time to merge PRs
  - median time to close issues
- The `Activity` tab shows selected-window raw counts and throughput ratios together so users can interpret percentages in context
- The `Activity` tab is the primary home for activity-flow ratios such as PR merge rate, issue closure rate, and stale issue ratio; these ratios are explained in context here before they are reused in any later cross-repo ratio rollup
- The `Activity` score in the `Activity` tab follows the selected recent-activity window, while the overview badge may continue to use the canonical default score window
- The first implementation focuses on ratios and fixed-window comparisons; full time-series trend charts for commits, PRs, and issues are a follow-up once bucketed trend data is carried in the shared analysis payload
- Activity score — High / Medium / Low — assigned only when sufficient verified data exists; otherwise surfaces `Insufficient verified public data`
- Activity score is based on a weighted combination of:
  - recent volume: commits, PRs, and issues across `30d`, `90d`, and `180d`
  - flow: PRs merged vs. opened and issues closed vs. opened
  - cadence: release cadence and version frequency
  - completion speed: median time to merge PRs and median time to close issues
- Activity scoring proposal for the first implementation:
  - `20%` PR flow
    - PRs opened vs. merged vs. closed
    - PR merge rate
  - `20%` issue flow
    - issues opened vs. closed
    - stale issue ratio
  - `20%` completion speed
    - median time to merge PRs
    - median time to close issues
  - `20%` sustained activity
    - commits across `30d`, `90d`, and `180d`
  - `20%` release cadence
    - release frequency
    - version movement
- Score interpretation proposal:
  - `High`: sustained recent activity, healthy PR/issue flow, meaningful release cadence, and relatively fast merge/close medians
  - `Medium`: meaningful activity is present, but cadence, throughput, or completion speed is uneven
  - `Low`: weak recent activity, weak flow, stale completion times, or little meaningful release motion
  - `Insufficient verified public data`: minimum required activity and flow inputs are not available
- Activity score should balance absolute volume with ratios and medians, so larger repositories do not automatically outrank smaller but healthy ones
- `Activity` owns throughput, cadence, and time-to-completion signals, while `Responsiveness` remains focused on first-response and maintainer-engagement latency
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- UI exposes thresholds via a "How is Activity scored?" help surface and keeps primary values visible without tooltip-only disclosure
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI

**Out of scope**
- User-adjustable thresholds in the UI (Future backlog)
- Commit frequency broken down by day of week or time of day
- Full commit / PR / issue sparkline charts before bucketed trend series are added to the shared `AnalysisResult` payload

---

#### `[P1-F09]` Contributors

The Contributors workspace measures the depth and distribution of contributor activity, with a dedicated Sustainability pane for broader resilience and organizational-risk signals.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Top-level results navigation places `Contributors` immediately after `Overview`
- The `Contributors` tab includes a `Recent activity window` control with presets:
  - `30d`
  - `60d`
  - `90d` (default)
  - `180d`
  - `365d`
- Changing the `Recent activity window` updates contributor-derived metrics locally without rerunning analysis
- The `Contributors` tab is organized into two panes:
  - `Core`
  - `Sustainability`
- The initial `Core` pane in `P1-F09` includes:
  - a `Contributor composition` summary card
  - `GitHub API contributors` as the top-level contributor-count source
  - active / repeat / one-time / inactive contributor composition for the selected recent-activity window
  - contributor-composition ratios such as repeat contributors / total contributors and new contributors / total contributors when those ratios are publicly verifiable from the shared analysis payload
  - person-level contribution heatmap for the selected recent-activity window
- The `Sustainability` pane includes the Sustainability score and related explanation surfaces
- The `Sustainability` pane owns contribution concentration and related top-20%-share explanation surfaces
- The `Sustainability` pane also includes:
  - maintainer or owner count from supported public repository files such as `OWNERS`, `OWNERS.alias`, `MAINTAINERS`, `MAINTAINERS.md`, `.github/CODEOWNERS`, or `GOVERNANCE.md`
  - observed types of contributions from verified recent repository activity
- The `Sustainability` pane includes an `Experimental` subsection for:
  - Elephant Factor (best-effort heuristic using public GitHub org visibility)
  - single-vendor dependency ratio (best-effort heuristic using public GitHub org visibility)
  - explicit warning that these two estimates may be incomplete or inaccurate
- Resilience score — High / Medium / Low — derived from contribution dynamics data; assigned only when concentration data is verifiable
- Scoring logic: high contribution concentration = fragile; moderate concentration = moderate; distributed contributors = strong, with insufficient verified public data blocking the score when contributor-distribution evidence is incomplete
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI
- Missing data explicitly listed in the per-repo callout panel
- Additional later sustainability signals remain tracked in the product/docs roadmap rather than rendered as placeholder UI in the current pane:
  - no contributions in the last 6 months
  - new contributors (first verified contribution in last 90d)
  - new vs. returning contributor ratio per release cycle
  - organizational diversity
  - organization-level contribution heatmap
  - unique employer/org count among contributors
  - richer Elephant Factor and vendor-risk refinements beyond the experimental heuristic ([CHAOSS metric reference](https://chaoss.community/kb/metric-elephant-factor/))

**Out of scope**
- Manually overriding org affiliation
- Bus Factor calculation (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P1-F10]` Responsiveness *(CHAOSS: Responsiveness)*

The analyzer measures how quickly maintainers engage with community activity.

**Acceptance criteria**
- The `Responsiveness` tab is organized into panes that map directly to the feature's metric groups:
  - `Issue & PR response time`
  - `Resolution metrics`
  - `Maintainer activity signals`
  - `Volume & backlog health`
  - `Engagement quality signals`
- `Issue & PR response time` includes:
  - time to first issue response
  - time to first PR review
  - median response times
  - 90th percentile response times
- `Resolution metrics` includes:
  - issue resolution duration
  - PR merge duration
  - issue resolution rate (`closed / opened`) for the selected window
- `Maintainer activity signals` includes:
  - contributor response rate
  - ratio of bot responses vs. human responses
- `Volume & backlog health` includes:
  - stale issue ratio
  - stale PR ratio
- `Engagement quality signals` includes:
  - PR review depth
  - issues closed without comment
- Computed from exact timestamps in GraphQL issue and PR event data — no estimation
- Response and resolution metrics SHOULD expose both median and `p90` values when enough verified public data exists, so outliers are visible without requiring full event-history charts
- Responsiveness score — High / Medium / Low — assigned only when sufficient event data exists; otherwise surfaces `Insufficient verified public data`
- Responsiveness score is based on a weighted combination of:
  - `30%` Issue & PR response time
  - `25%` Resolution metrics
  - `15%` Maintainer activity signals
  - `15%` Volume & backlog health
  - `15%` Engagement quality signals
- All thresholds defined in config, not hardcoded in logic
- If GitHub does not surface required event timestamps via GraphQL, fields are marked `"unavailable"` and called out explicitly in the missing data panel
- CHAOSS category label displayed alongside the score in the UI

**Out of scope**
- Bus Factor and responder concentration risk, which belong in contributor/sustainability analysis
- Review turnaround time per reviewer
- Label assignment lag
- Open issue or PR trend charts over time
- Reopened issue rate
- SLA tracking over time (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P1-F11]` Health Ratios

Computed diagnostic ratios provide a quick cross-repo comparison surface, drawn from all four CHAOSS categories.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Ecosystem ratios: forks/stars, watches/stars
- Activity ratios: merged PRs/opened PRs, stale issues/total open issues
- Contributors ratios: repeat contributors/total contributors, new contributors/total contributors
- Ratios continue to appear first in their domain-specific home views where they are easiest to interpret:
  - ecosystem ratios remain in ecosystem and overview surfaces
  - activity-flow ratios remain in the `Activity` tab
  - contributor-composition ratios remain in the `Contributors` tab
- The `Health Ratios` tab aggregates those verified ratios into a dedicated cross-repo comparison table rather than becoming the first or only place the user sees them
- The `Health Ratios` tab groups those rollups into `Overview`, `Contributors`, and `Activity` sections so the comparison view mirrors the main workspace navigation
- Unavailable ratios displayed as `—`, never estimated
- Ratios grouped by CHAOSS category in the UI
- Table is sortable by ratio value across repos
- Ratios computed only from verified API values

**Out of scope**
- Custom ratio definitions by the user

---

#### `[P1-F12]` Missing Data & Accuracy

The UI makes data gaps explicit and never hides them.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Per-repo callout panel lists every field that could not be verified from the API
- Fields marked unavailable in the JSON output are visually distinguished in the UI (not hidden, not zeroed out)
- No metric is estimated, inferred, or substituted — enforced in the analyzer module and visible in the UI

**Out of scope**
- Suggesting alternative data sources for missing fields

---

#### `[P1-F14]` GitHub OAuth Authentication

User can authenticate with GitHub via OAuth instead of manually entering a PAT.

**Acceptance criteria**
- "Sign in with GitHub" button initiates the OAuth flow using a registered GitHub OAuth App
- OAuth access token is stored in `localStorage` — same storage contract as PAT
- OAuth token grants the same repository read access expected by the analyzer
- After successful OAuth login, the token input field is replaced with a signed-in indicator showing the GitHub username
- User can sign out, which clears the stored OAuth token from `localStorage`
- If a server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` is configured, the OAuth flow is hidden (same behavior as P1-F02)
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` are stored as environment variables — never committed, never sent to the client
- OAuth callback is handled server-side; the access token is never exposed in the URL

**Out of scope**
- Multi-account or org-level OAuth management
- Token refresh / long-lived session management (Phase 1 is stateless)
- Replacing PAT support — PAT and OAuth coexist; PAT remains available for users who prefer it

---

#### `[P1-F13]` Export

Users can take analysis results out of the UI in standard formats.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Download full `AnalysisResult[]` as JSON
- Download summary as Markdown report (CHAOSS-aligned format)
- Copy shareable URL that encodes the repo list as query params — token never included in the URL

**Out of scope**
- PDF export
- CSV export
- Saved reports or report history (Future backlog)

---

### Phase 2 — GitHub Action

---

#### `[P2-F01]` Scheduled Analysis

RepoPulse runs as a GitHub Action on a schedule or manual trigger.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Action supports `schedule` (cron) and `workflow_dispatch` triggers
- Repo list supplied as action input: multiline string or JSON array
- Imports `analyze()` directly from the shared analyzer module — no logic duplication
- Outputs JSON artifact uploaded to GitHub Actions artifacts
- Optional Markdown summary posted as a GitHub Actions job summary
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` consumed from the action's built-in secret — no extra setup for public repos

**Out of scope**
- Push or release event triggers (Future backlog)

---

#### `[P2-F02]` Threshold Alerting

The action can open a GitHub Issue when health drops below a defined threshold.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Optional step: opens a GitHub Issue if any CHAOSS score falls below configured threshold
- Issue body includes the Markdown health report
- Threshold values sourced from the shared config — not hardcoded in the workflow

**Out of scope**
- Slack or email notifications (Future backlog)

---

### Phase 3 — MCP Server

---

#### `[P3-F01]` Analyze Tool

RepoPulse exposes repo health analysis as an MCP tool callable by AI assistants.

**Acceptance criteria**
- MCP Server exposes an `analyze_repo` tool
- Tool accepts: `repos: string[]`, optional `token?: string`
- Tool returns a typed `AnalysisResult` object matching the shared analyzer output contract
- Wraps `analyze()` from the shared analyzer module — no logic duplication
- Usable from Claude, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI assistant

**Out of scope**
- Streaming partial results during analysis
- Tool for adjusting scoring thresholds

---

#### `[P3-F02]` Deployment & Integration Docs

The MCP Server is deployable and documented for common AI assistant setups.

**Acceptance criteria**
- Deployable as a standalone Node.js process
- Deployable as a Vercel serverless function
- README section documents how to connect to Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` passed via environment variable — never hardcoded

**Out of scope**
- GUI for configuring the MCP server

---

### Future / Backlog

Not specced. Captured here so Phase 1–3 decisions don't foreclose them.

- `[FUT-F01]` **Historical trending** — store snapshots over time, chart metric trajectory per repo
- `[FUT-F03]` **CHAOSS expansion** — Bus Factor, Change Request Closure Ratio, Code Coverage metrics
- `[FUT-F04]` **Embeddable badge** — `![RepoPulse Health](https://repo-pulse.vercel.app/badge/owner/repo)` for READMEs
- `[FUT-F05]` **Webhook mode** — trigger analysis on push or release events via GitHub webhook

---

## Development Workflow

See [`docs/DEVELOPMENT.md`](./DEVELOPMENT.md) for the full SpecKit feature loop, Definition of Done, and phase-by-phase feature order.
