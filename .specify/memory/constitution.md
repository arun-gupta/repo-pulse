# ForkPrint Constitution

**Single authoritative source of all project rules.**
Every spec, plan, task, and line of code must comply. No exceptions.

---

## I. Technology Stack

### Phase 1 — Web App
- **Framework**: Next.js 14+ (App Router) — no Pages Router
- **Deployment**: Vercel — zero-config
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Charts**: Chart.js (via npm)
- **Stateless**: no database, no auth system, all analysis is on-demand

### Phase 2 — GitHub Action
- Implemented as a GitHub Action workflow
- Imports `analyze()` from the shared analyzer module — no runtime duplication
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` consumed from the action's built-in secret

### Phase 3 — MCP Server
- Deployable as a standalone Node.js process
- Deployable as a Vercel serverless function
- Wraps `analyze()` from the shared analyzer module

### API Contract (Phase 1)
```
POST /api/analyze
Body:     { "repos": ["owner/repo", ...], "token"?: "ghp_..." }
Response: { "results": AnalysisResult[] }
```

### Stack Constraints
- No technology outside this stack may be introduced without amending this constitution.
- The analyzer module must remain runtime-agnostic — it cannot import from Next.js, the Actions SDK, or any MCP library.

## II. Accuracy Policy (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

1. Every metric displayed or exported must originate from a verified GitHub GraphQL API response. No other origin is acceptable.
2. No estimation, interpolation, inference, or fabrication — ever. Missing data is a first-class outcome, not a failure to hide.
3. Missing fields are marked `"unavailable"` in JSON output and visually distinguished (never hidden, never zeroed) in the UI.
4. One metric may never substitute for another. Each field maps to exactly one GraphQL field or derived formula over verified fields.
5. Scores are assigned only when sufficient verified data exists. When data is insufficient, the output is the literal string `"Insufficient verified public data"` — not a score, not a guess.
6. If the GitHub GraphQL API does not expose a required field, that field is marked `"unavailable"` and listed explicitly in the per-repo missing data panel.

---

## III. Data Source Rules

1. **Primary source**: GitHub GraphQL API (`https://api.github.com/graphql`).
2. Each repo requires 1–3 GraphQL requests. Precise field selection — no over-fetching.
3. REST API may supplement only where GraphQL cannot reach a specific metric. This is an exception, not a pattern.
4. Auth: Personal Access Token (classic) OR GitHub OAuth App — both are supported in Phase 1. Minimum scope: `public_repo` read-only.
5. `GITHUB_TOKEN` is always read from environment. It is **never hardcoded** anywhere in the codebase.
6. Server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` (Vercel env var) takes precedence over client-supplied token or OAuth session.
7. Token is never included in URLs, never exposed to the client bundle, never logged.
8. OAuth requires a `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` — both stored as environment variables, never committed to git, never sent to the client.

---

## IV. Analyzer Module Boundary

1. The core analysis logic lives in a single, **framework-agnostic analyzer module**.
2. The analyzer module is **shared across all three phases**: Phase 1 (Next.js), Phase 2 (GitHub Action), Phase 3 (MCP Server).
3. No phase duplicates analyzer logic. Phases 2 and 3 import and wrap `analyze()` — they do not reimplement it.
4. The analyzer module has no dependency on Next.js, GitHub Actions runner APIs, or any MCP framework.
5. Phase 1 architectural decisions must not block Phases 2 or 3. The module boundary enforces this.
6. The analyzer module is independently testable without any phase-specific harness.

---

## V. CHAOSS Alignment

Four CHAOSS categories. Each maps to exactly one feature and produces exactly one derived score. This mapping is fixed.

| CHAOSS Category  | Feature ID | Feature Name            | Score Name           | Score Values                              |
|------------------|------------|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Ecosystem        | P1-F05     | Ecosystem Map           | Ecosystem profile    | Reach / Builder Engagement / Attention    |
| Evolution        | P1-F08     | Evolution               | Evolution score      | High / Medium / Low                       |
| Sustainability   | P1-F09     | Contribution Dynamics   | Resilience score     | High / Medium / Low                       |
| Responsiveness   | P1-F10     | Responsiveness          | Responsiveness score | High / Medium / Low                       |

Rules:
- Every CHAOSS category label is always displayed alongside its score in the UI.
- Scores map to badge colors: High = green, Medium = amber, Low = red, Insufficient = gray.
- No new CHAOSS categories or additional scores may be introduced without amending this constitution.

## VI. Scoring Thresholds

1. **All thresholds are defined in configuration** — not hardcoded in logic, not inline in components, not in constants files treated as logic.
2. Threshold values must be readable and modifiable without touching scoring logic.
3. The UI exposes thresholds via a "how is this scored?" tooltip for each CHAOSS score.
4. Phase 2 threshold alerting sources values from the shared config — not from the workflow YAML.
5. The following scores use config-driven thresholds:
   - Evolution score (P1-F08): commit frequency, PR merge rate, stale issue ratio, release cadence
   - Resilience score (P1-F09): contribution concentration, contributor count, repeat contributor ratio
   - Responsiveness score (P1-F10): median first response time, median time to close issues, median PR merge time

---

## VII. Ecosystem Spectrum

1. P1-F05 uses a **spectrum model**, not median-derived quadrants.
2. Axes: X = stars (reach), Y = builder engagement (`forks / stars`), bubble size = attention (`watchers / stars`).
3. Ecosystem profile tiers are **ForkPrint-defined** and aligned to the CHAOSS ecosystem category. They are not presented as an official CHAOSS taxonomy.
4. Spectrum thresholds are defined in shared configuration and read from that configuration by the UI and supporting logic.
5. Single-repo input remains fully valid: the UI still plots and profiles the repo when verified data exists.

---

## VIII. Contribution Dynamics Honesty

1. **Organizational affiliation is not verifiable via the GitHub GraphQL API.** This is a known platform constraint.
2. When org affiliation cannot be verified, the output is the exact string: `"Could not verify contributor organization publicly"` — never an approximation, never a guess, never inferred from username patterns.
3. The Resilience score logic acknowledges this constraint explicitly:
   - High concentration + single org → fragile
   - High concentration + multiple orgs → moderate
   - Distributed + multiple orgs → strong
   - Distributed + **unknown orgs** → moderate confidence *(not strong — org diversity is unverified)*
4. The UI never implies that org diversity has been confirmed when it has not.
5. Missing org data is listed in the per-repo missing data panel.

---

## IX. Feature Scope Rules

1. Each Phase 1 feature (P1-F01 through P1-F13) is a behavioral contract, not an implementation task.
2. Acceptance criteria in `docs/PRODUCT.md` define the testable surface. Implementation must satisfy all criteria.
3. Out-of-scope items listed in `docs/PRODUCT.md` are hard boundaries — do not implement them under any feature.
4. Future/backlog items (FUT-F01 through FUT-F05) must not influence Phase 1–3 architecture unless the constitution is amended.
5. `AnalysisResult` schema must be flat and consistent enough to diff across repos without transformation — design this from the start (P1-F06 constraint that applies to all upstream features).

---

## X. Security & Hygiene

1. No secrets (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, PATs, credentials) ever committed to git.
2. `.env*` files are always in `.gitignore`.
3. Token never transmitted anywhere except the GitHub GraphQL API endpoint.
4. Token never included in shareable URLs or query params.
5. Per-repo error isolation: one failed repo must not block or corrupt results for others.

---

## XI. Testing

1. **TDD is mandatory (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**: tests written and approved → tests fail → implement → tests pass. Red-Green-Refactor cycle strictly enforced.
2. Testing layers:
   - **Unit/Integration**: Vitest + React Testing Library for analyzer logic and UI components
   - **E2E**: Playwright for full user flows (repo input, dashboard rendering, export)
3. GitHub GraphQL API calls are mocked in unit tests. Real API calls are used only in E2E tests.
4. All tests must pass before merging to `main`.

---

## XII. Definition of Done

A feature is complete only when all of the following are true:

- [ ] All acceptance criteria in the feature spec are satisfied
- [ ] Tests pass and linting is clean
- [ ] No TODOs, dead code, `console.log`, or untyped values remain
- [ ] All spec documents for the feature are current
- [ ] `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` reflects the feature's completed status in the implementation order
- [ ] `specs/NNN-feature-name/checklists/manual-testing.md` exists for the feature
- [ ] Manual testing checklist completed and signed off
- [ ] README updated for any user-facing or setup changes
- [ ] Constitution compliance verified — no rule violated

---

## XIII. Development Workflow

1. All work happens on feature branches. No direct commits to `main`.
2. All tests must pass and linting must be clean before a PR is merged.
3. Every feature must maintain `specs/NNN-feature-name/checklists/manual-testing.md`.
4. A manual testing checklist must be completed and signed off before submitting a PR.
5. README must be updated to reflect any user-facing or setup changes before submitting a PR.
6. `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` must be updated when a feature is completed so the implementation order reflects current status.
7. A PR must be opened and merged before starting the next feature.
8. Credentials go in `.env.local` only — never committed. `.env.example` is committed with placeholder values.
9. README is updated when a completed feature changes the user-facing behavior or setup steps.

## Governance

- This constitution supersedes all other guidance when rules conflict.
- Amendments require: (1) a documented reason, (2) an updated version number and date, (3) a review of all existing specs for compliance impact.
- All specs, plans, and PRs must be verified against this constitution before approval.
- Any rule marked **(NON-NEGOTIABLE)** cannot be amended without explicit human sign-off — not by Claude Code autonomously.
