# RepoPulse — OSS Health Score

RepoPulse measures the health of open source projects with a composite **OSS Health Score** — a single percentile-based score computed from Activity, Responsiveness, Sustainability, and Documentation, calibrated against 1600+ real GitHub repositories.

Analyze any public repo, see exactly where it ranks, and get actionable recommendations for improvement.

## What it measures

| Dimension | Weight | What it evaluates |
|-----------|--------|-------------------|
| **Activity** | 30% | PR throughput, issue flow, commit cadence, release frequency |
| **Responsiveness** | 30% | Issue/PR response times, resolution speed, backlog health, engagement quality |
| **Sustainability** | 25% | Contributor concentration, repeat/new contributor ratios |
| **Documentation** | 15% | README, CONTRIBUTING, LICENSE, SECURITY, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, CHANGELOG |

Each dimension is scored as a percentile relative to repos in the same star bracket (Emerging, Growing, Established, Popular). The weighted composite becomes the overall health score.

### Coming soon

| Dimension | What it will evaluate |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Security** | Dependency updates, branch protection, CI/CD, vulnerability disclosure |
| **Community** | Discussions, issue/PR templates, CODEOWNERS, governance |
| **Release Health** | Frequency, semver compliance, release notes |
| **Inclusive Naming** | Default branch naming, inclusive terminology in repo metadata |

## Getting started

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Required env vars (create a [GitHub OAuth App](https://github.com/settings/developers) with callback URL `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback`):
