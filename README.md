# RepoPulse

RepoPulse is a CHAOSS-aligned GitHub repository health analyzer. The Phase 1 app lets you analyze one or more public repositories, explore an organization’s public repo inventory, and compare repositories side by side in a web dashboard. Export is still on the roadmap.

Live in action: [repopulse-arun-gupta.vercel.app](https://repopulse-arun-gupta.vercel.app)

## Roadmap

- Phase 1: Next.js web app on Vercel for interactive repository analysis
- Phase 2: GitHub Action for scheduled analysis and alerting
- Phase 3: MCP server callable by tools such as Claude and Cursor

## Getting Started

RepoPulse supports a server-side `GITHUB_TOKEN` or the browser PAT flow. For local development, you can optionally set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Optional local env:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

For recommended token type and permissions, use the `GITHUB_TOKEN` setup guidance in [`docs/DEPLOYMENT.md`](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#local).

## Product
