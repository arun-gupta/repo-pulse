# ForkPrint

ForkPrint is a CHAOSS-aligned GitHub repository health analyzer. The current Phase 1 app accepts one or more `owner/repo` inputs, fetches verified public data from GitHub, and presents summary cards and ecosystem signals in a web dashboard, with broader comparison and scoring features still on the roadmap.

Live in action: [forkprint-arun-gupta.vercel.app](https://forkprint-arun-gupta.vercel.app)

## Roadmap

- Phase 1: Next.js web app on Vercel for interactive repository analysis
- Phase 2: GitHub Action for scheduled analysis and alerting
- Phase 3: MCP server callable by tools such as Claude and Cursor

## Getting Started

ForkPrint currently supports a GitHub Personal Access Token with `public_repo` read-only scope. For local development, you can optionally set `GITHUB_TOKEN` in `.env.local`.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

Optional local env:

```bash
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```
